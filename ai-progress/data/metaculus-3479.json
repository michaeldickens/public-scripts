Our aim is for systematic thinkers to engage with the wealth of AI forecasts that Metaculus has built up over the years. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analyses we would like to see are those that synthesize Metaculus' AI forecasts, that draw out their key implications, and assemble these into a coherent view of the future of AI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dreyfus prize is to be awarded to five authors of the best analyses of the future of AI. The prize is named after Hubert Dreyfus, an American philosopher, well-known for his incisive and prescient analyses of the prospects and limits of AI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the goals of the contest are as follows:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To encourage and support rigorous and nuanced thinking about the future of AI that engages with quantitative probabilistic forecasts</li>\r\n<li>To Identify and reward the top thinkers and forecasters focused on the future of AI</li>\r\n<li>To provide an arena for discussion and exchange of ideas regarding the future of AI, and especially the likelihood, timing, and impacts of <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/some-background-our-views-regarding-advanced-artificial-intelligence#Sec1\">transformative AI</a>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Fortified Essay writers will have their work reviewed by a distinguished panel of judges:</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src=\"https://metaculus-media.s3.amazonaws.com/user_uploaded/jack.jpeg\" align=\"left\" img style=\"float: left; margin: 15px 15px 15px 15px;\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\"> Jack Clark is a co-founder of Anthropic, the co-chair of the AI Index, an expert member of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, the co-chair of the OECD's working group on classifying and defining AI systems, and a non-resident research fellow at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology.

Justify your views with, amongst other things, reference to quantitative predictions.</li>\r\n<li>How much progress in AI algorithms and architectures has there been in the past decade, and how much should we expect in the next decade? Justify your views in reference to quantitative predictions, such as those involving performance on some common ML benchmarks. </li>\r\n<li>Can we map the disagreements between notable figures in the AI risk community, as presented in the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/n945eovrA3oDueqtq\">Late 2021 MIRI Conversations</a>, onto disagreements about quantifiable predictions? Which views do we expect to imply predictions that we think are likely to fare better, and why? </li>\r\n<li>When will AI-enabled automation constitute a negligible fraction of US GDP? Justify the view that this may or may not happen this century. </li>\r\n<li>Is Deep Learning sufficient for achieving Transformative AI (roughly, AI that precipitates a transition comparable to the agricultural or industrial revolution), if not, how many new substantial insights might be needed?</li>\r\n<li>How might the trajectory of the field of AI look like if Moore’s Law were seriously stunted in the next decade? How might the rate of progress be affected, and where would the field look for new sources of improvements?</li>\r\n<li>What fraction of the field of AI will be dedicated to working on AI Safety, broadly defined?
