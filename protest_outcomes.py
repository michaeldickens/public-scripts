    Calculate pooled outcome using a random-effects model.

    When combining outcomes from multiple studies, you can use either a
    fixed-effects model or a random-effects model. A fixed-effects model
    assumes that all protests are equally effective, and it estimates the
    expected effectiveness of protests given the observed data. A
    random-effects model assumes that the effectiveness of protests can vary,
    and it estimates the effectiveness of the *average* protest.

    For an explanation of the math, see:

    random-effects models for meta-analysis.
